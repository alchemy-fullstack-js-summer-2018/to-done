To Do App
===

This is a simple app for making a to-do list. It was made using React and Firebase and tested using Jest.

## How to Use
1. Fork and clone the repo
1. Run `npm i` inside the repo directory to install all the necessary packages.
1. Run `npm start` to launch the website - it will access my specific public Firebase database.
* If you'd like to run my tests, run `npm run test`.
